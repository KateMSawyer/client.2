    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
      <h2> why i choose...</h2>
   <p>In section 4 i had began to choose the parts in the computer for client 2 and for this part i had gone on a bunch for websites 
     and and found high powered but cheap computer parts and had checked for prices and had used those to compare to other ones and
     found the best fit for each part of this computer. For the mouse and key board i had done the same but had gone on amazon and 
    ebay and bestbuy to find the products to compare prices. In section 5 i had to read what the client had looked at it in a way 
     that what would be teh easiest set up, what would work the best and what would be the most logical idea for their needs and 
     i had thought that the bus networking would work the best for this client adn his needs. In section 6 i had gone throught and 
     thought what would you need to make the products and share through linux and what is the easiest way for them tho do it. </p>     </p>
