 <h1> Reflection</h1>
<p>What i found was the most difficult about this project was find the products and learning everything that was put into a computer
  and how much was in each product. I learned that making a multiple pages website is alot simplier then what it looks and sounds 
  and that you can make a website for anything it can be neat and orginized in the website. I also found that its alot easier
  when your code is orginized in the work too. I would not want to do the other client because even thought client 2 had to be cheap 
  having no limit on money and having more products to find would be more complicated in my opinion and would confuse more of me and 
  would be ian issue with finding the products you need and that work rather then the expensive flashy one that doesnt work that well.</p>
