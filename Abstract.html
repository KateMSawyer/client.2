            <h1> Abstract </h1>
<p>For client 2 i have found cheap but very high in quality computers for the coders to be able to work and play high quality games
    i have found a way to get more storage then when it just has the memory card in it. There is th applications that i believe are needed i
    for client 2 and his work. there is also what set up with peer to peer and the materials you will need to set that up
    You will find the folder structuring that is used for orginizing your work and what would work very well for client 2. you will 
    see the parts and prices of every product i had chosen for this client and how they will work together and how well
     they will work for this client and his line of work. Client 2 is needing these products for cheap and that is what i have done for said 
    client and how all the pooint fit together very nicely.
