        <h1>Networking</h1>
        
        <h2> The network the client needs set up</h2>
        <p> The network that would need to be set up for the computer is a LAN (local Area Network) because the way they 
            <br>could set this up is by being local between of the the clients helpers for this project and they could conenct
            with<br> the local serveer but also using the local networking system. The Bus network would work for clients 2 needs
            with having to be able to work<br> and connect the projects to his co workers and having the bus set up is that every 
            work station is connected to a main cable which is called the bus<br> which just means that every sation is connected to 
            another directly. I believe peer to peer would work better in the instance because it is a group<br> of people working on 
            one project and if one needs to get into a file they would not need to ask and there would be a quicker work flow in<br> 
            this case and they can connect to eachothers works. For the bus networking for a physical topology you would need a 
            10Base5 (thick coaxial cableup to 500m) and a 10Base 2 (thin coaxial cable up to 185m). To set up peer to peer you 
            would need 10Base-T adapters, and only two computers,<br> you can directly connect one  computer to the other with a 
            crossover cable and 10Base-T adapters and more than two computers you will need<br> a 10Base-T hub to connect them. The
            Networking protocols and applications would be file transfering protocol, bluetooth protocols most likely and a ip 
            protocols. The applicationa would be a LAN like i had discussed earlier. The file sharing methodology that would work 
            for client 2 would be with peer to peer is you could using is Bittorrent whicj is a communication protocol for 
            tranfering large files which would be useful for these clients.
